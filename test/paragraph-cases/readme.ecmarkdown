  # Introduction

  This is a document describing Ecmarkdown.

<emu-clause id="c1">
  # Clause 1
  This is paragraph content. You can reference _variables_ and other
  inline formatting in paragraphs too.

  1. Numeric lists are implicitly counted as algorithms.
  2. Everyone loves algorithms.

  This is paragraph content.

  ## Syntax

  Second-level headings are rare in most Ecmarkdown documents, as
  `<emu-clause>` plus first-level headings usually serve better. But
  in some cases you want a heading that does not show up in the table
  of contents, so you can use `##` or `###` syntax.

  <emu-grammar>
    Foo :
      `bar` Baz
  </emu-grammar>

  The contents of `<emu-grammar>`, `<emu-production>`, `<pre>`,
  `<code>` and `<script>` tags are left alone by Ecmarkdown.

  <emu-clause id="sub-clause">
    # Foo(_p1_, _p2_)
    Notice how headers can also use Ecmarkdown inline elements.
  </emu-clause>

  <aside>This content will *not* be processed by Ecmarkdown.

  But this content will be, since it's on a new line.

  It's being on the same line as an opening that
  stops processing.</aside>
</emu-clause>
